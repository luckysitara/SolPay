# SolanaPay

## Overview
SolanaPay is a decentralized payment gateway built on the Solana blockchain, enabling users to send and receive payments in various cryptocurrencies quickly, securely, and with low fees. It aims to provide a competitive alternative to traditional payment gateways by leveraging Solana’s high transaction throughput and decentralized network.

## Problem Statement
Traditional payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, and Paystack face several issues that hinder seamless financial transactions for both merchants and customers:
- **High Transaction Fees:** Traditional gateways often charge high fees per transaction, reducing profit margins for merchants.
- **Slow Processing Times:** Transactions can take several days to process, especially cross-border payments, causing delays in fund availability.
- **Centralization Risks:** Centralized systems are prone to single points of failure, censorship, and security vulnerabilities.
- **Limited Cryptocurrency Support:** Many traditional gateways do not support cryptocurrency payments, limiting options for users who prefer decentralized digital currencies.
- **Complex Integration:** Integrating traditional gateways can be cumbersome and expensive, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
